# About me


I’m a software developer and math teacher in the Western North Carolina area. I have been doing remote tutoring since 2019 through an agency I founded called [MosaicMath](http://MosaicMath.com), and have been building software professionally since 2021. 

I like working on software projects where I get to think of “data infrastructure,” which in my mind covers everything from setting up React components to ETL development. I find my motivation to be placed on projects with real business or personal impact! My academic training was in pure mathematics where I focused on real analysis. In the past I’ve worked in childcare, IT, and textbook production. 

My favorite past times include reading ribbonfarm, e-biking, and watching John Coogan videos.

A little project to transform data scraped through twitter into a merkle tree, to be used for an NFT mint whitelist.
